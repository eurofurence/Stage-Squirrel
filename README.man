Installation Manual for Stage Squirrel
================================================================================
1.  Execute initial_load.sql to create database 'stagesquirrel'
    and fill important data.
2.  Opt. create new SQL user with access to the database, giving following
    rights: select, delete, insert, update.
3.  Make sure both npm and node are present in your $PATH variable
4.  Type 'npm install' in Stage Squirrel root will install all dependencies
    given by package.json
5.  Copy config/config.js.dist to config/config.js
6.  Open config/config.js to change settings:
        - you can change the sessionsecret
        - insert your database user
        - Setup baseurl to match the URL users will use to access this
          Stage Squirrel installation
7.  Setup ip' and 'port' in server.js according to your needs
    (by default, Stage Squirrel will listen on interface 127.0.0.1 and port 8500)
8.  Open config/startup.conf and make changes where applicable
9.  In Stage Squirrel root, type './stagesquirrel test-config' to test your
    startup-configuration
10. Copy config/logrotate.conf.dist to config/logrotate.conf and
    config/startup.conf.dist to config/startup.conf respectively.
11. Opt. open config/logrotate.conf and set the first line to match the
    absolute path to your logfile (as configured in config/startup.conf)
        - By default, logfiles will be rotated daily and held for as long as
          90 days. Configure this to your needs.
12. Edit the following line to point to your config/logrotate.conf and add it
    to your local crontab (usually by running crontab -e):

	# This will rotate the console.log  daily at 06:00, compress rotated logs and keep them for 90 days
	0 6 * * * /usr/sbin/logrotate -s /dev/null /home/stage/Stage-Squirrel/config/logrotate.conf > /dev/null 2>&1

        - If this doesn't work, check if you distribution placed logrotate in
          another path or no longer comes with it. This configuration is
          intended for usage without elevated privileges. If you are the
          system maintainer, feel free to alter this to your needs.
